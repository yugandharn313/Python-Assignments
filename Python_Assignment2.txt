continue is going to skip the current step

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

range(10) --> it will return the values upto 10

range(0, 10) --> it will return the values between 0 and 10

range(0, 10, 1) --> it will return the values between 0 and 10 with increment of 1 value everytime


12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent

   print(i)

While loop:

i=1
while(i<11):
